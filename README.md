mi first repositoy// mi primer repositorio
Coming out from a non- programming environment but really attracted by numbers and the story behind them got enrolled in the data science specialization on John Hopkins University
  Passionate about  Formula 1, I would like to crunch the numbers in every GP weekend and, hopefully get to some conclussions about trends, the teams and drivers that are going up or going down, the future lap times, and so on, all this using data science techniques and tools
  May be all this could evolve in a career in data science
